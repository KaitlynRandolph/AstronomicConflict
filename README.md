# SpaceInvadersGame
This is a Space Invaders-like game that I made by following Spunky Kangaroo on Youtube's tutorial. I am working to add my own additions to further flesh out the game.

<b>My own additions:<br></b>
-Cleaned up code's readability by implementing more functions<br>
-Changed window size<br>
-Drew my own background and sprites & implemented them<br>
-Altered controls so there is an alternative to left/right arrows and the ship doesn't run off the edges of the window<br>
